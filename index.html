                <h1 class=text-center>About Me</h1>
                <p class=text-center>My name is Spencer Kleeh and I am a third-year student at The University of Cincinnati 
                    pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am originally from Pataskala, Ohio and graduated from Watkins Memorial Highschool in 2019. 
                     I have been programming since my freshmen year of highschool and have experience with many programming languages such as C#, C++, Python, Java, and the languages used 
                     in the Angular framework. I have completed 2 Co-Op rotations with FIS in Cincinnati, Ohio working on the Innovation team. 
                     In my free time I like to play chess and watch movies. Thanks for viewing my page and feel free to contact me via email any time!</p>

                                    During this Co-op rotation I worked on an idea called PayAway, brought to us by FIS' Tom Bruns and David Miller. 
                                    This project was an app that would be integrated into a companies point of sales system that would allow for credit card transactions to handled over the phone, without the client having to read off their credit card number. 
                                    I worked on the front-end of this project, writing scripts in typescript while also using the angular framework to create of proof of concept that would show a payment happening start to finish.

                                    This rotation I was with FIS for two semesters because I worked part time for them during a school semester. During the first half I worked on a project given to us called AT^2 which stands for Automated Testing and Analysis Tool. 
                                    My role shifted from front-end to back end on this project where I became more proficent with Java and its Spring Boot framework. 
                                    I worked to create the back-end database in mySql that would store specific APIs and also the API that would retrieve those APIs that are stored, ping them, then decide if they were functional or not. 
                                    During the second part I used the .NET framework to work on creating a system for integrating smaller companies into FIS. FIS has become a bit of a conglomerate so a lot of the companies they incorporated have different systems for processing clients. 
                                    The API I did some maintainance on basically took in those customers and shifted their information into a universal FIS system.

                                    I was the Internal Vice-President of my chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
                                    This role brought with it many challenges, as our chapter is around 40 members and I was soley in charge of our By-Law amemendment and maintainance. As well as our housing committee, scholarship committee, and risk management committee.
                                    During this position I learned valuable skills in leadership and communication.

                                    During my freshmen year I took calculus two. The homework we had to do was online, and involved a lot of integrals. To check work and make sure we wouldn't lose any points 
                                    a lot of people I know would plug stuff into the website "Integral Calculator" before submitting just to be sure, but this took a long time. Luckily the integrals were embedded 
                                    into the HTML so using python, selenium and bs4 I scraped the integrals, plugged them into the integral calulator, got the resutls and populated the homework in a matter of seconds.
